# PeopleBox Data Analyst Intern
In this repository, I have included the transformation scripts and documentation for two exercises completed as part of the PeopleBox Data Analyst Internship. The exercises involve transforming employee data from a columnar format into a historical, row-based versioning format suitable for database storage.

## Exercise 1: Historical Employee Records Transformation

Objective: Transform current employee data into a historical, row-based versioning format.
Input: 'input.csv' containing employee data.
Output: 'output.csv' containing transformed employee records.
Google Colab: You can also run this transformation process in Google Colab using the provided link.

## Exercise 2: Survey Response Analysis

Objective: Analyze a dataset from a survey response in a company.

The dataset consists of two main tables:

Employees: Contains information about employees such as ID, name, department, location, gender, age, and manager ID.
Responses: Contains the responses to the survey, including the driver name, score, and employee ID.

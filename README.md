# PeopleBox Data Analyst Intern
In this repository, I have included the transformation scripts and documentation for two exercises completed as part of the PeopleBox Data Analyst Internship. The exercises involve transforming employee data from a columnar format into a historical, row-based versioning format suitable for database storage.

## Exercise 1: Historical Employee Records Transformation

1:- Objective: Transform current employee data into a historical, row-based versioning format.

2:- Input: 'input.csv' containing employee data.

3:- Output: 'output.csv' containing transformed employee records.

4:- Google Colab: You can also run this transformation process in Google Colab using the provided link:- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZFKl1yMpjUsvLYM8RgoJ9bxR66Q73eti?usp=sharing

## Exercise 2: Survey Response Analysis

Objective: Analyze a dataset from a survey response in a company.

The dataset consists of two main tables:

Employees: Contains information about employees such as ID, name, department, location, gender, age, and manager ID.
Responses: Contains the responses to the survey, including the driver name, score, and employee ID.
